HR Analytics Dashboard

A modern HR Analytics Dashboard designed to mirror real-world internal tools used by HR, HRIS, and healthcare IT teams. This project demonstrates frontend engineering skills, product thinking, and domain awareness in workforce data and analytics.

Note: This is a portfolio project currently using mock HR data to demonstrate frontend architecture, data visualization, and internal-tool UX patterns. The system is designed to be extended with real backend services and databases.

🏥 Real-World Use Case

This dashboard simulates internal tools used by HR and healthcare organizations to:
	•	Monitor workforce composition and departmental distribution
	•	Quickly locate employee records during audits or reporting
	•	Visualize trends for staffing and organizational planning
	•	Provide leadership with clear, accessible workforce metrics

The emphasis is on clarity, usability, and decision support, rather than surface-level visuals.

🔮 Planned Enhancements

This project is actively evolving. Planned additions include:
	•	Real Database Integration
Replacing mock datasets with a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to support persistent employee records and reporting
	•	Backend API Layer
Introducing a Node.js-based API for authentication, data access, and business logic
	•	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Differentiated access for HR administrators, managers, and standard users
	•	Scalable Data Models
Normalized schemas designed for growth, audits, and compliance-driven reporting

These enhancements are intended to more closely mirror production HRIS and healthcare IT systems.

🎯 What This Project Demonstrates
	•	Building internal-facing enterprise tools, not just consumer apps
	•	Translating business and compliance needs into usable UI
	•	Clean component architecture and separation of concerns
